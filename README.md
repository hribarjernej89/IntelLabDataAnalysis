# Extracting covariance model parameters from Intel lab data

In this Notebook, we analyse data provided by the [Intel Berkeley Research laboratory](http://db.csail.mit.edu/labdata/labdata.html) to extract scaling parameters for the covariance models for our paper entitled "Using Correlated Information to Extend Device Lifetime in the Internet of Things" . To extract the covariance models paramaters we follow Tilmanm  Gneiting instructions as presented in his paper: [Nonseparable, stationary Covariance Functions for Space-Time Data](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3085674). [Our code](https://github.com/hribarjernej89/Nonseparable_Stationary_Covariance_Functions_for_Space-Time_Data) replicating his experiment.

We use temperature and humidity measurements from nine sensors to extract covariance models scaling parameters. We focus only on a subset of available sensors residing in one single room because only sensors deployed in the same room are subject to the same environmental factors, e.g. air circulation. We average multiple updates over an hour to provide time domain consistency necessary to calculate temporal correlation. We start by calculating space-time correlation for time lag zero. At time lag zero we compare measurements acquired at the same hour To obtain empirical temporal correlation, we calculate the average of empirical space-time correlation for a specific time-lag. It is noticeable that humidity has a better temporal correlation in comparison to temperature. In a case for humidity data is correlated even when time lag is nine hours, in contrast to temperature empirical correlation that is negligible after six hours. In the next step, we fitted the models to data points. All three covariance models provide a reasonable fit, indicating that all three models are applicable in these two particular scenarios.
